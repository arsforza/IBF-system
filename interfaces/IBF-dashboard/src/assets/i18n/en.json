        "EGY": "Flood susceptibility identifies the most vulnerable areas based on physical characteristics that determine the propensity for flooding” (Vojtek and Vojtekova, 2019). The mapping of flood susceptible areas involves the analysis of multiple criteria for different characteristics of the region that collectively contribute to the likelihood of floods.<br/><br/>Nine influencing parameters based on a variety of satellite imagery and spatial datasets are the input factors of the model, such as topographical (Elevation model, Slope), physical (Land cover, Hydrological soil group) and hydrological properties (Height Above Nearest Drainage, Distance from Nearest Drainage, Topographic Wetness Index Slope, Rain intensity, Rain duration). Set of weights based on expert knowledge (The Analytical Hierarchical Process) from REACH (2019) was adapted in this analysis.<br/><br/><strong>LEGEND:</strong> There are 4 classes of flood susceptibility. The higher the flood susceptibility, the darker blue the color.<br/><br/>SOURCES:<ul><li>REACH.
